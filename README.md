# Social Grove

Social Grove is a social dining experience that lets users suggest dishes to be served to determine the menu. It uses React on the frontend and a simple json-server on the backend to manage the data

Regular users can add dishes and drinks and vote on their favorites. Admin users can remove items that don't meet the guidelines

You can view a deployed version [here](https://social-grove.surge.sh/).
